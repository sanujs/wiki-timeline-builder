# Wiki Timeline Builder
This is a client-side web app that generates timelines from items in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). 

*This project is still in early development so many items will not display as intended.*

**[Try it out!](https://stackblitz.com/github/sanujs/wiki-timeline-builder)**

## "Good" Examples
These examples aren't perfect, but they work better than others. Just search any of these terms in the demo :)
- [Mona Lisa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12418) (You get every instance when it was vandalized)
- [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
